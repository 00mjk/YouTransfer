It is an alternative to paid services like [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and [WeTransfer](http://wetransfer.com) by offering similar features but without limitations, price plans and a lengthy privacy policy. You remain in control of your files.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Docker\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to install YouTransfer in your own environment is to use the [Docker image](http://hub.docker.com/r/remie/youtransfer/):\r\n\r\n`docker pull remie/youtransfer`\r\n\r\nYou can run the application with the following command:\r\n\r\n`docker run -d -v [path_to_upload_folder]:/opt/youtransfer/uploads -v [path_to_config.json]:/opt/youtransfer/config.json -v [path_to_settings.json]:/opt/youtransfer/settings.json -p 80:5000 remie/youtransfer`\r\n\r\nYou can now connect to YouTransfer by browsing to http://[docker_host_ip]/\r\n\r\nN.B. the `config.json` file is the application configuration. This is static information: it cannot be modified on runtime. In addition, it is a placeholder for default values of user settings. The `settings.json` file contains all settings that can be adjusted through the web interface. It is recommended to store this outside the Docker container for persistance.\r\n\r\n### NodeJS\r\n\r\nIf you wish to run YouTransfer directly from source, you will need to install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org). \r\n\r\nDownload the latest release zip file from [GitHub](https://github.com/remie/YouTransfer/releases) or clone the repository from https://github.com/remie/YouTransfer.git\r\n\r\nTo install YouTransfer, run `npm install && npm run dist`.\r\nAfter installation, start YouTransfer using `PORT=[port] node app.js`.\r\n\r\nYou can now connect to YouTransfer by browsing to http://localhost:[port]/\r\n\r\n### NPM\r\n\r\nYouTransfer is also available as an NPM package. This allows you to start a new [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) project, edit the source and customize the experience for your users.\r\n\r\nYou can install the NPM package by running `npm install youtransfer -g`.\r\n\r\nCreate a new empty directory for your project, e.g. '~/meTransfer'. Run `youtransfer init` in your project directory, which will copy all necessary files. Finalise the project setup by running `npm init` and `npm install`.\r\n\r\nOnce your project is ready you can run `npm start` to start the application. Your project will now be available in your browser (http://localhost:5000). You can change the default port in the `config.json` file.\r\n\r\nFor local development, the `npm run dev` command which will start 'gulp-watch' to automatically regenerate the static content upon change.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Hosting\r\n\r\n#### Ngrok\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to host YouTransfer from your local system is to use [Ngrok](http://ngrok.com). This will create a secure tunnel between your computer and the NGrok servers, exposing the YouTransfer application to the outside world. \r\n\r\nNGrok offers secure connections using SSL, which is highly recommended.\r\n\r\n#### Reverse Proxy\r\n\r\nIf you are hosting YouTransfer on your own servers, it is recommended that you add a reverse proxy in front of the application. There are several solutiona available, like [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org), [Nginx](http://nginx.org) or [Apache Httpd](http://httpd.apache.org). \r\n\r\nA reverse proxy can be configured to support SSL, access rules and other security features which are not part of YouTransfer.\r\n\r\n### Uploading & sharing files\r\n\r\nThis should be the easy part :)\r\n\r\nYou can upload the files using drag & drop (depending on browser support) or by using the file input field on the form. Uploading will start automatically. As soon as the file has been transferred succesfully, a file-specific token will be provided. You can use this token to download the file to your computer. \r\n\r\nFile sharing is done by publishing the access token.\r\n\r\n#### Browser compatibility\r\n\r\nYouTransfer will always work with the latest version of any major browser, and will try to support up to three prior versions. There is one exception: drag & drop support for file uploading. This relies on HTML5 and more specifically the ability for data transfer. See the DropzoneJS [compatibility chart](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#browser-support) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n- [Remie Bolte](https://github.com/remie)\r\n\r\nYou can contribute by forking the project and sending pull requests.
